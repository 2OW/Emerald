# Emerald
Welcome to the official Emerald repository! Emerald is a W.I.P Discord bot project. Before you go looking at my super duper secret code, there are some things you need to know.

# Terms
Alright, let's get into the juicy stuff! The terms for my stuff!

- Any replication of my code is okay. However, I have to be credited, please be aware of this. 
- Really, that's all I want to go over for terms. 

# Issues
If you want to report an issue that is occuring with Emerald, you can report the issue on the issues tab and I'll get back to you. 

# Extras
- I use Visual Studio Code for my coding and starting of the bot.

- Surprisingly, I use my late 2013 MacBook Pro instead of my main custom-built Windows PC for coding. This is because it doesn't like code that much and just won't shut on on my Windows PC. 

- Emerald runs purely off of JavaScript and discord.js.
